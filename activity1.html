    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Monkey D. Luffy</strong>, but you can just call me <strong>Luffy</strong>.</p>
    <p>I’m from Foosha Village and I’m 19 years ol. My birthday is on <u>May 05, 2000</u> , nd I am a pirate aiming to become the King of the Pirates.<br>
    I sail on the <i>Thousand Sunny</i> with my crew, the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>

    <p>My mother’s name is <s>unknown</s>, and my father’s name is <s>Monkey D. Dragon</s>. I have one brother, and his name is <mark>Portgas D. Ace</mark>.<br>
    My hobbies include eating meat, adventuring across the seas, and testing my rubber powers. Most of the time, I spend searching for treasure and fighting strong opponents.<br>
    My dream is to find the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates.</p>
